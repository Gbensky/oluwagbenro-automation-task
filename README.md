## Automation Tests

### Test Scenarios

#### Scenario 1

- Search with valid Text

###### Reason: 
This is literally the happy path of the search functionality if this fail
then the search functionality will be useless to users.

###### Implementation Steps: 
- Enter a valid Text in the search box
- Click the search box
- Review Corresponding results by ensuring that search text is present in
all search result

#### Scenario 2

- Search with Invalid Text

###### Reason: 
Users should be notified when their search text doesn't match any record in 
the application rather than been given random results.  This way the user 
can refine the search text.

###### Implementation Steps: 
- Enter an invalid Text in the search box
- Click the search box
- Review Corresponding results by ensuring that no result is returned.

### Automation Frameworks

#### E2E UI Framework

**Cypress:** This was used because it is one of the most stable framework for Web application.
It was built to cater to the asynchronous behaviour of Javascript which is used majorly in 
building web applications. This ensures that flaky tests do not occur as Cypress only runs
the tests when the Web application is fully loaded. Cypress is also very easy to install and maintain.

#### API Framework

**Mocha, Chai, SuperTest:** This combination was used because it is lightweight and easy to install. It
also gives room for building a robust framework as it is easy to build custom functions and methods.
